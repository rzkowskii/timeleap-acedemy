* Displays code output or error messages.
* Integrates code sharing functionality.
5.10 LoginForm Component
* Handles user authentication (email/password).

5.12 QASection Component
* Displays existing questions and answers for each chapter.
* Allows users to ask new questions and answer existing ones.
* Integrates with the backend to persist Q&A data.
6. State Management
* Use React Context API for global state management.
* Implement separate contexts for authentication, theme, and course data.
* Use local component state for UI-specific state (e.g., form inputs, toggles).
7. API Integration
Implement an API service with the following endpoints:
* GET /courses: Fetch all course data.
* GET /modules/:moduleId: Fetch a specific module.
* GET /modules/:moduleId/chapters/:chapterId: Fetch a specific chapter.
* POST /quiz-scores: Submit a quiz score.
* POST /shared-code: Save and share code from the sandbox.
* GET /shared-code/:id: Retrieve shared code.
8. Authentication and Authorization
* Implement JWT-based authentication.
* Store tokens securely in localStorage.
* Include authentication headers in API requests.
* Implement protected routes that require authentication.
9. Styling and Theming
* Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling.
* Implement a theme switcher for light and dark modes.
* Ensure all components are styled for both light and dark themes.
10. Accessibility
* Ensure proper heading hierarchy.
* Use ARIA labels where necessary.
* Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly.
* Maintain sufficient color contrast in both light and dark modes.
11. Performance Considerations
* Implement lazy loading for course content.
* Use React.memo() for components that don't need frequent re-renders.
* Optimize images and other assets.
12. Testing
* Implement unit tests for individual components using Jest and React Testing Library.
* Create integration tests for key user flows.
* Implement end-to-end tests using Cypress.
13. Deployment
* Set up a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions).
* Configure deployment to a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
* Implement environment-specific configuration for development, staging, and production.
14. Future Enhancements
* Implement real-time collaboration features in the coding sandbox.
* Add support for different types of quizzes (e.g., multiple choice, true/false, coding challenges).
* Integrate a discussion forum for general course discussions.
* Implement a recommendation system for related chapters or topics.
* Add support for course creation and management by instructors.
